# Atlas Web Dart

Welcome to the `atlas-web_dart` project! This repository contains a series of tasks designed to help you learn the basics of the Dart programming language. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of Dart and will guide you through writing simple programs and understanding key concepts.

## Tasks

### 0. Hello Holberton!

Write a Dart program that prints `Hello Holberton!` followed by a new line.

- Use the function `print`.

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `0-hello_holberton.dart`

### 1. The Quotes

Write a Dart program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

- Use the function `print`.

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `1-quotes.dart`

### 2. Print Number

Complete this source code to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

- The output should be: the number, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.
- You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string.
- Your code must be 4 lines long.

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `2-print_number.dart`

### 3. Print Doubles

Complete this source code to print the double stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

- The output should be: `Double: ` followed by the double with only 2 digits, followed by a new line.

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `3-print_double.dart`

### 4. Print String

Complete this source code to print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

- The output should be: 3 times the value of `str`, followed by a new line and the first 9 characters of `str`, followed by a new line.
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
- Your program should be a maximum of 5 lines long.

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `4-print_string.dart`

### 5. Assertion

Complete this source code to make it check if the number is bigger or equal to 80. Print `You Passed` otherwise the output should be `Uncaught Error: Assertion failed: "The score must be bigger or equal to 80`.

- You are not allowed to use `IF/ELSE`.

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `5-assertion.dart`

### 6. Positive Anything is Better than Negative Nothing

Write a Dart program that, given an argument, determines if it is positive or negative.

- The variable `number` will store as a string. You should convert it to an integer.
- The output should be:
  - If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
  - If the number is 0: `is zero`
  - If the number is less than 0: `is negative`

**Repository:**
- GitHub repository: `atlas-web_dart`
- Directory: `0x00-hello-dart`
- File: `6-positive_or_negative.dart`
